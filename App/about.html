    <p>
      This app has been built with a focus on recreating the 15-Line IndoPak
      Mushaf, memorizing the Quran and quick search engine for the arabic text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content also aims to provide a line by line translation of the text
      which requires manually setting each line for the arabic text.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other apps provide either a continous text, or a version separated
      by ayahs.
