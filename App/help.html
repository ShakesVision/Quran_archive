    <h2>Read</h2>
    <p>
      All the content is available in UNICODE that means you can search and
      copy-paste everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the left/right navigation buttons on the bottom to got to
      next/previous pages. You can also type the page number to directly jump at
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruku number, Surah names and number, Juz names and number etc. are
      automatically calculated based on each page to replicate scanned version.
    </p>
    <h2>Search</h2>
    <p>
      The top right corner has 3 dots button for more options and settings. One
      of the most prime features is blazing-fast search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search function works with any keyboard, Arabic or Urdu. With or
      without tashkeel? Doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're going to search with exact matches, disable the "ignore
      tashkeel" toggle, which will search WITH tashkeel.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can copy and share all the test results by clicking on "Results" line
      which shows number of results and time used for search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Search results are rendered in virtual scroll, so even the huge number of
      results doesn't matter. For example, search for اللہ or فی, which will
      return in 1000s of results without any lag or hang problem.
    </p>
    <h2>Font, Colors</h2>
    <p>
      For styles, you can increase/decrease the font size or change the font for
      a different text corpus, say AlQalam.
    </p>
    <p>You can set a text color, and a background.</p>
    <p>
      Background can be a color or an image url in the format
      url(https://example.com/image.png)
    </p>
    <p>
      As the color/bg fields accept valid css, you can put a hex color (#
      format), rgb color, color names (yellow, red) etc. For image, you can put
      additional layout styles say repeate image, stretch, positioning it to
      center etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Quick navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Typing a juz or surah number will take you to that page directly in a
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hidden feature: You can type Juz number dot Ruku number to jump to that
      ruku number of a juz. e.g: 27.10 will take you to 10th ruku of 27th Juz.
    </p>
    <h2>Scan Version</h2>
    <p>
      A scanned version is also available for those who want to contribute in
      our project by proofreading/translation setting. You can also use it for
      your personal recitation if you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scan version doesn't have search/copy functionality but you can use the
      easy navigations available to jump between surahs, juz, ruku, page and
      sections etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Memorization</h2>
    <p>
      A juz can be added for memorization with page number. So if you've
      memorized 4 pages of Juz 30, you can click on + button and enter 30 and 4
      respectively, which will save this in the phone memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app also reflects the same memorization stats in Juz page for easy
      tracking and motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've memorized a new page, you can EDIT the respective entry by
      clicking on the corresponding row, and update the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use your same memorized data in some other device, or maybe
      you're just afraid of losing your data, the memorization page gives option
      to Export and Import the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can export the data, which will copy all the records in your
      clipboard, then you can keep it somewhere safe as a backup, or import it
      back in the app on other device.
    </p>
    <h2>Listen to recitations</h2>
    <p>To listen to any surah's recitation, click on respective rows.</p>
    <p>
      On the top right corner, the 'person' icon can be clicked on to change the
      reciter. The same function is available on the top of surah list.
    </p>

      tips and tricks.
